Need to get pictures from Dante's inferno

In the beginning was the

    void

    (put that in code style)

-or-

In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was
God.

    int main (int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Hello World");
        return 0;
    }

When Man (and Woman) first started programming we were in a Paradise; but then
due to our most human failings we fell from grace and were cast out.

Luxuria:

Gula:
    We want our program to do all things.  Every feature must be in it!

Avaritia:
    We covet

Acedia:
    We do things quickly; we don't keep the code clean; we let tests break.

Ira:
    We 

Invidia:
    We wish our code did all the cool things that we see other programs doing.

Superbia:
    We think we know what is best; that everyone else is wrong.
